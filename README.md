# Audio Visualization

An audio visualizer with FFT analysis and shader rendering.

Written in C++ with [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) and GLSL. The shader uses a ray marching algorithm to render geometric primitives.

Replace *music.ogg* (MP3 not supported) to visualize a different audio source.
